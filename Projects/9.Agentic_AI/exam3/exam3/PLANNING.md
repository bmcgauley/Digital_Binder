## Project: Multi-Agent Personal Assistant (Archon MCP)

### Overview
This project implements a personal assistant composed of at least 6 specialized agents, each capable of leveraging MCP tools and self-guided workflows to accomplish a wide range of professional and personal tasks. The system is orchestrated using the Archon MCP tool, enabling autonomous, collaborative, and context-aware task execution.

### Agent Roles
1. **Email Agent**: Checks, reads, and manages emails; extracts actionable items and schedules events.
2. **Calendar Agent**: Updates and manages the user's calendar based on email, tasks, and user input.
3. **Research & Paper Agent**: Prepares, reviews, and summarizes academic or business papers; assists with citations and formatting.
4. **Client Analysis Agent**: Analyzes client businesses, generates reports, and provides recommendations.
5. **Web Development Agent**: Codes, debugs, and deploys websites for clients; handles both frontend and backend tasks.
6. **Systems Analysis & Design Agent**: Conducts systems analysis, designs solutions, and reports findings.

#### Optional Extensions
- **Task Orchestration Agent**: Delegates and coordinates tasks among agents.
- **Reporting Agent**: Aggregates results and reports back to the user.

### Architecture
- **Archon MCP**: Central orchestrator, receives user tasks, delegates to appropriate agents, and manages tool usage.
- **Agent Modules**: Each agent is a modular, self-contained component with access to relevant MCP tools and APIs.
- **Shared Context**: Agents share context and results via a central state or message bus.
- **Extensibility**: New agents can be added with minimal changes to the core system.

### Design Principles
- Modular, extensible, and testable codebase
- Clear separation of concerns between agents
- Use of Pydantic for data validation
- FastAPI for any API endpoints
- Pytest for unit and integration tests
- All agents leverage MCP tools for external actions

### File Structure
- `/agents/` - Agent implementations
- `/tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `main.py` - Entry point and Archon MCP integration
- `PLANNING.md` - This file
- `TASK.md` - Task tracking
- `README.md` - Project documentation

### Next Steps
1. Scaffold the directory and file structure.
2. Implement agent base class and individual agents.
3. Integrate with Archon MCP tool.
4. Implement orchestration logic.
5. Write unit and integration tests.
6. Update documentation.

### Progress Notes
- [2025-05-06] Scaffolded `/agents` and `/tests` directories as per Next Steps.
