# Titanic Survival Prediction Model Improvement Report

## Summary
This report documents the improvements made to the Titanic survival prediction model, which raised the accuracy from approximately 50% to 75.98%, exceeding the target of 70% accuracy.

## Original Model Limitations

The original model had several limitations that affected its performance:

1. **Data Loss**: Important predictive information was discarded when dropping columns like `Name`, `Ticket`, and `Cabin`.
2. **Missing Value Handling**: The approach of dropping all rows with missing values resulted in significant data loss.
3. **Feature Set**: The model relied only on basic features without creating meaningful derived features.
4. **Outlier Removal**: Entire rows were removed when outliers were detected in the `Fare` column, reducing the training data.
5. **Preprocessing**: All features were normalized using the same approach, without considering their nature (categorical vs. numerical).

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Feature Engineering

#### Extracted Information from Previously Dropped Columns
- **Passenger Titles**: Extracted from `Name` (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) and grouped rare titles
- **Deck Information**: Extracted from first letter of `Cabin` values
- **Family Information**: Created meaningful family-related features

#### New Derived Features
- **FamilySize**: Combined `SibSp` + `Parch` + 1
- **IsAlone**: Binary indicator for passengers traveling alone
- **AgeGroup**: Categorized ages into meaningful groups (Child, Teenager, Adult, Elderly)
- **FareCategory**: Bucketed fare values into quartiles
- **Embarked_Pclass**: Interaction feature combining embarkation point and passenger class

### 2. Improved Data Processing

#### Missing Value Handling
- **Imputation Instead of Deletion**: Used median imputation for `Age` and `Fare`
- **Mode Imputation**: Used the most frequent value for categorical features like `Embarked`
- **Preserved Data**: Retained all rows instead of dropping them, maintaining the full dataset size

#### Outlier Management
- **Capping Instead of Removal**: Capped extreme values in `Fare` to the upper/lower bounds
- **Preserved Data Points**: Kept all data points while minimizing the impact of extreme values

#### Smarter Preprocessing
- **Targeted Normalization**: Only normalized numerical features (`Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `FamilySize`)
- **Proper Encoding**: Used LabelEncoder for all categorical features

### 3. Model Performance Improvement

| Metric | Original Model | Improved Model |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Accuracy | ~50% | 75.98% |
| Precision | N/A | 67.82% |
| Recall | N/A | 79.73% |
| F1-Score | N/A | 73.29% |

## Feature Importance Analysis

The correlation analysis revealed the most important features for survival prediction:

| Feature | Correlation with Survival |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Sex | -0.543351 |
| Pclass | -0.338481 |
| Deck | -0.301116 |
| Embarked_Pclass | -0.254180 |
| IsAlone | -0.203367 |
| Fare | 0.317430 |

This confirms historical accounts that women, higher-class passengers, and those from certain decks had higher survival rates.

## Conclusion

The improved model demonstrates that effective feature engineering and data processing techniques can significantly enhance predictive performance without changing the underlying algorithm. The key takeaways are:

1. **Extract Information**: Don't discard valuable data in categorical features
2. **Create Meaningful Features**: Domain knowledge can guide the creation of powerful predictive features
3. **Preserve Data**: Use imputation and outlier capping instead of row removal
4. **Apply Appropriate Preprocessing**: Different feature types require different preprocessing approaches

These principles can be applied to other machine learning tasks to improve model performance.
